# Timbre
This project aims to create deep learning tools for musicians to work with the timbre of different sounds and instruments.

This project is in a initial developing stage.

## Datasets

- PiancoChordDatastet: Dataset with 450 piano chords audios.

## Models

- PianoChordVAE: VAE for encoding piano chords in a low-dimension latent space (2D - 3D). This latent space can be used to create new sounds of piano chords or create chord sequences by moving through the latent space.
