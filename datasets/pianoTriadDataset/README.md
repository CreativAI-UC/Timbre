- Data type: 16-bit PCM (int16)
- File size: Each example has a file size of 128 kB (553 MB for `/audio/` folder and 5.53 GB for `/audio_augmented_x10/` folder).
- Duration: 4 seconds

Note:
- The audios are in 16-bit PCM (int16) data type to reduce te file size. This means that the dinamic range of values in the array is -32768 to 32768. To normilize the audios in the range -1 to 1 just divide by 32768.
